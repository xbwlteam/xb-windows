<h1>Implementing the sqlite3 Database System with XBasic
	Begin by installing Visual Studio with the C++ compiler
	option, if you have not already done so.
	
	Download the following from the sqlite website:
		sqlite3 source
		sqlite3 dll (+.def)
		
	Download the sqlite3.dec and TestSqlite.x files from the GitHub - xbwlteam - 
	XBWindows - Documentation Library-Code web page
	
	Copy sqlite3.dll to c:\xb\bin
	Copy sqlite3.def to c:\xb\bin
	Copy sqlite3.dec to c:\xb\include
	
	Load the Visual Studio app and select Tools/Command Line/Developer Command Line
	On the terminal, go to the location of the sqlite source code and .def and .dll
	files and compile the sqlite3.lib file as follows:
		LINK /lib /DEF:sqlite3.def
		
	Copy sqlite3.lib to c:\xb\lib
	
	In XBasic PDE, load the program TestSqlite.x. Note the use of
		IMPORT "sqlite3"
	In the program Prolog.
	
	The test program should now run correctly.
